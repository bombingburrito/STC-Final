He cheated while playing for prize money, he cheated while streaming and he cheated while playing against the worlds best players. This begs the question why are some people still defending him in this whole Magnus fiasco?

Even if he did not cheat in his game against Magnus or never cheated OTB, which seems highly unlikely, don't you think that playing against a renowned cheater could have a deep mental effect towards you. Even if Magnus does not have a 100 percent proof that Hans cheated against him, he is is completely in the right to never want to play against him or even smear him publicly. I am actually surprised that other players have not stated the same and if Hans ""career"" is really ruined after all that has happened, he has only himself to blame.

>159.Likewise, contrary to Chess.com’s self-serving contention that it merely wanted to
ensure the integrity of the 2022 Chess.com Global Championship tournament, Chess.com allowed several players who had previously been banned from online chess for cheating in high profile
events to participate in that tournament.

>160.In fact, Sebastien Feller, a European Grandmaster who was caught cheating at the
2010 Chess Olympiad tournament and subsequently banned from participating in FIDE-sanctioned
events for nearly three years, is currently playing in the same tournament as Carlsen—the 2022
European Club Cup—with no objection whatsoever from Chess.com or Carlsen. Likewise,
Magnus recently played a FIDE-sanction game against Parham Maghsoodloo, who was also
banned for Lichess.org for cheating. Apparently, Carlsen only reserves his protests for those who
have defeated him and threaten to undermine the financial value of Carlsen’s brand and the Merger.",hera47m4,2022-10-21,1221,0.96, ,/r/chess/comments/y9ioza/hans_lawsuit_claims_that_chesscom_allowed_known/

I’m here to take a stand for one of the very rare times I’ve seen Jeopardy make a mistake, though. Another answer in the round involved the prestigious title “International ____” - someone buzzed in with “Grandmaster” and was deemed correct. “International Grandmaster” is not the official title, right? The answer clearly should have been “What is Master” - the titles are too distinct to allow this answer on the basis of being linguistically similar.

5. Emil Sutovsky (Director-General of FIDE) sends out a wild tweet with huge implications: [https://twitter.com/EmilSutovsky/status/1566854973559869442?t=csFv42yriyo2xcFEhs\_kcA&s=19](https://twitter.com/EmilSutovsky/status/1566854973559869442?t=csFv42yriyo2xcFEhs_kcA&s=19)
6. It emerges that Hans has been banned before on Chess.com for cheating. In Link 1, Hikaru mentions it without 'technically' doing so, while in Link 2 GM Andrew Tang also talks about it ambiguously although the implication is quite obvious:  
*Link 1 (Hikaru):* [https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru/clip/BlitheDrabSwordJKanStyle-5yUuq5mQoGpjKl2N](https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru/clip/BlitheDrabSwordJKanStyle-5yUuq5mQoGpjKl2N);

7. It further emerges there is even a clip of Nepo on his own stream from like a year ago talking about Hans using a bot: [https://www.twitch.tv/lachesisq/clip/ConfidentInspiringStorkCmonBruh?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/lachesisq/clip/ConfidentInspiringStorkCmonBruh?filter=clips&range=all&sort=time)
8. Nepo gives an interview after drawing his game against Wesley and gives quite a reaction:  
*Link 1-*[https://twitter.com/GrandChessTour/status/1566867536809021441?cxt=HHwWgsC-2aPu0L4rAAAA](https://twitter.com/GrandChessTour/status/1566867536809021441?cxt=HHwWgsC-2aPu0L4rAAAA);

9. Going back to the [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCeJrItfQqw) Hans gave after beating Magnus in Round 3, he mentioned how he “miraculously” looked at an obscure line that happened in the game and that he had only looked at it because of **Magnus had played it against Wesley So in the 2018 London Chess Classic.** Drama frog investigators (and Hikaru) now realize no such game exists. [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6qcqr/chessbase\_has\_no\_record\_of\_magnus\_ever\_playing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6qcqr/chessbase_has_no_record_of_magnus_ever_playing/)
   1. **Edit**: A similar game entering a different line between [Carlsen v. So in Kolkata 2019](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1981206) has been widely pointed to as the possible game of reference; however, there has been considerable debate as to whether this game could be the one.
      1. Former WC challenger GM Nigel Short has tweeted that it could have, as well as GM Denes Boros in his recent video:  
Nigel's tweet: [https://twitter.com/nigelshortchess/status/1567020771528130561?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/nigelshortchess/status/1567020771528130561?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)  
Denes talking about transpositions from this game: [https://youtu.be/v0ry3kPrioY?t=229](https://youtu.be/v0ry3kPrioY?t=229)
      2. While others like Hikaru, Wesley, and u/BetaDjinn have argued the contrary:  
Hikaru saying that the Kolkata game has a ""**completely different structure**"": [https://youtu.be/sqAeJ72BUYw?t=10878](https://youtu.be/sqAeJ72BUYw?t=10878)

u/BetaDjinn offering commentary on why the lines could not have been the game Hans was referring to: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6xdk0/the\_whole\_hans\_niemannmagnus\_carlsen\_withdrawal/in9gtxb/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6xdk0/the_whole_hans_niemannmagnus_carlsen_withdrawal/in9gtxb/?context=3)
      3. **\*\*UPDATE:** Hans, in his Round 5 postgame interview, clarified this matter. He was referring to a transposed game (did not name which, but likely the Kolkata game), mentioning that he was referring to the concepts of such a position. Among many other things, in reference to all the speculation linked above, he said ""**people are absolute idiots**"" because ""**the explanation I'm going to give is going to make you all look--\[and\] all the top GMs look like idiots""** and that ""**this is just embarrassing""**. [https://youtu.be/CJZuT-\_kij0?t=590](https://youtu.be/CJZuT-_kij0?t=590) *(he spends around 5 minutes explaining from this timestamp onwards)*
      4. **\*\*UPDATE 2:** Hikaru has clarified his stance on his 09/08 stream, see Update #46.
10. During this whole saga, Wesley So (among many others, including Levy, Jorden Van Foreest, Shant Sargsyan and more) has been in Hikaru's chat commenting various things, among those stating that ""I wasn't even in London in 2018"", confirming the previous point (#9) [https://logs.ivr.fi/?channel=gmhikaru&username=gmwso123](https://logs.ivr.fi/?channel=gmhikaru&username=gmwso123)
11. Levon gives his take where he backs Hans, says ""**all of my colleagues are pretty much paranoid**"" with regard to cheaters: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6rh3o/levon\_on\_hans\_i\_never\_have\_this\_kind\_of\_feeling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6rh3o/levon_on_hans_i_never_have_this_kind_of_feeling/)
12. Somewhere around here, Tony Rich, Executive Director of the Stl Chess Club, comes onto the official broadcast to talk about Magnus' withdrawal, explain the additional security measures which caused the delay at the start of the round, and how the tournament will go on with 9 players: [https://youtu.be/J6ZLG6h6rkE?t=13064](https://youtu.be/J6ZLG6h6rkE?t=13064)
13.  Alireza and Hans draw their game, and then Hans gives his interview on the official broadcast, but the engine evaluation is turned off (as opposed to previous days when it was on for him) and Hans gives an “incoherent” analysis per Eric Hansen.The official interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI9jAU0jhJU&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI9jAU0jhJU&feature=youtu.be)Eric’s reaction to his interview:

14. Alireza then gives his side in an interview where he mentioned being totally perplexed by various decisions Hans made during the game, suggesting he “completely missed” multiple lines that Hans saw. He even mentions Hans' Qg3 as ""shocking"": [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6swdg/alireza\_thought\_hans\_qg3\_move\_was\_insane/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x6swdg/alireza_thought_hans_qg3_move_was_insane/)
15. Fabiano gives his postgame interview with Stl Chess Club and also alludes to others knowing the reason why Magnus withdrew (implying others have the same cheating allegation): [https://twitter.com/GrandChessTour/status/1566939239471894528?s=20&t=qhxJ\_DSfYRqLkPoQT08moA](https://twitter.com/GrandChessTour/status/1566939239471894528?s=20&t=qhxJ_DSfYRqLkPoQT08moA)

17. GM Rafael Leitao chimes in, saying his own analysis (done with ""powerful engines"") shows Hans played with no engine aid: [https://twitter.com/Rafpig/status/1566941524486651911](https://twitter.com/Rafpig/status/1566941524486651911) (tweet needs to be translated)
18. Fabiano sends out an enigmatic tweet after his game (presumably) having caught up on the drama: ""*Can't wait to hear more about the Hans effect on The Magnus Effect*"" [https://twitter.com/FabianoCaruana/status/1566959985736679424?cxt=HHwWgICw8cHz-r4rAAAA](https://twitter.com/FabianoCaruana/status/1566959985736679424?cxt=HHwWgICw8cHz-r4rAAAA)
19. GM Denes Boros publishes an analysis going over the games (as well as a more nuanced look at the drama), which goes into depth about whether Hans' moves look human or not, and whether his postgame interview analysis gaffes are suspicious, among other details. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ry3kPrioY&ab\_channel=ChessWeeb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0ry3kPrioY&ab_channel=ChessWeeb)
20. **\[\*\*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED READ\*\*\]** GM Jacob Aagaard, a well-known trainer and Chess author who previously worked with Hans, publishes a long blog post defending Hans and talking about his personal experiences training Hans, saying that **""I have seen nothing out of the ordinary in the last two days,"" Hikaru's coverage of the drama has been ""bizarre"" and** **""ridiculous"",** and ""\[Hans'\] moves were **nothing special""**, among many other things. [https://forum.killerchesstraining.com/t/paranoia-and-insanity-by-jacob-aagaard/856](https://forum.killerchesstraining.com/t/paranoia-and-insanity-by-jacob-aagaard/856)

22. Hikaru on his stream concerning the emerging theory that Magnus' prep got leaked and that's why he withdrew: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x7fb2b/hikaru\_on\_carlsen\_prep\_leak\_theory\_to\_me\_makes\_no/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x7fb2b/hikaru_on_carlsen_prep_leak_theory_to_me_makes_no/)

24. GM Daniel King on the entire situation: ""If you wish to, you can find evidence that supports a view that he was cheating, but you could find evidence that supports a view that his play is completely clean; it's just confirmation bias, it seems to me."" [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x7fglq/gm\_daniel\_king\_shares\_his\_thoughts\_on\_the\_drama/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x7fglq/gm_daniel_king_shares_his_thoughts_on_the_drama/)
25. \[Fairly major missed update from yesterday\]: the official St. Louis Chess Club retweets a Hikaru tweet where Hikaru is promoting his new video. Except the new video is about why Magnus quit/Hans potentially cheating. As seen here: [https://twitter.com/GMHikaru/status/1566962692706934786](https://twitter.com/GMHikaru/status/1566962692706934786)
26. Maurice Ashley, appearing on the official STL Chess Club broadcast, does all but confirm that Hans has been banned for cheating in the past: ""we know there are some issues with Hans in the past--some issues that are pretty well documented about him possibly cheating and him taking punishment for that.""

27. Nepo, having drawn his Rnd.5 game with MVL, is asked about Magnus/Hans in his postgame interview: ""frankly speaking, it's a very big threat for chess and hopefully everything will be alright and Hans will prove himself innocent.""  He further compares a Vishy game to the current situation and has a lot to say about fixing and cheating:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOdyOPgRRGQ&ab\_channel=SaintLouisChessClub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOdyOPgRRGQ&ab_channel=SaintLouisChessClub)
28.

30. Nikita Vitiugov, reigning Russian champion and Nepo's second, posts a very long statement on Twitter (in Russian) concerning the matter. A relevant comment of his (among many, many more), translated via DeepL: ""There are no serious anti-cheating measures, giving players a sense of complete safety, in chess. Along with the frames, metal detectors, delayed broadcasts, there is the certainty of their ""circumvention""."" [https://t.me/colchonero\_64/29](https://t.me/colchonero_64/29)

33. GM Daniel Naroditsky on his stream comments on the possibility of cheating OTB, in particular at the STL Chess Club: ""in my opinion, it is not particularly hard \[to cheat\]--the way anti-cheating measures are set up right now \[in STLCC\]--if you put your mind to it, it is possible to set up a cheating mechanism even in very high profile tournaments."" Purportedly he also ended stream saying that **Magnus needs to ""shit or get off the pot""** (unverified).

34. Hikaru booted up stream this morning and has been relentlessly harried by chat (despite it being in sub-only mode) to watch the interview and furthermore respond. Mostly, he has just reiterated that he only [""said it was a fact that \[Hans\] cheated online""](https://clips.twitch.tv/SlipperyRamshacklePlumageKippa-n4iHDK8YT_sVMTPr) and otherwise not said much. Also when asked to apologized, **he said, ""apologize for what?"":** [https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru/clip/AnimatedRespectfulReubenBigBrother-TAOZ2zMlQQ12HxkI?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time](https://www.twitch.tv/gmhikaru/clip/AnimatedRespectfulReubenBigBrother-TAOZ2zMlQQ12HxkI?filter=clips&range=24hr&sort=time)
35. Laurent Fressinet, Magnus' second, comments on the Hans situation on The Chicken Chess Club podcast: ""I met \[Hans\] in Paris at a chess bar where we played some blitz with Jules Moussard, and he kicked our ass. He was very overconfident and thought he would become the next WC. So I'm not surprised. But **Naka is trying to sell some stories and saying some bullshit**, Hans is clearly 2700 level.""

39. Ben Finegold uploads a video on the drama. A notable quote (1:40 in the video): ""Hans didn't cheat, and Magnus is a huge dick now. Now Magnus needs to apologize now, unless, unless, he withdrew for the proper reasons, that is, he is very sick, or someone in his family is very sick.""

41. **\[BIG DEVELOPMENT\]** With Hikaru neither responding to Hans' comments in the Rd.5 postgame interview nor watching Hans' interview on stream, Hans sends out two passionate tweets directed at Hikaru:
42. *Tweet 1:* ""**The silence of my critics clearly speaks for itself. If there was any real evidence, why not show it? Hikaru has continued to completely ignore my interview and is trying to sweep everything under the rug. Is anyone going to take accountability for the damage they've done?**"" [https://twitter.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1567660677388554241](https://twitter.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1567660677388554241)
43. *Tweet 2*: ""**Hikaru plays the victim but seems to forget dedicating hours of his stream to criticize all of my interviews. with frivolous insinuations. Perhaps he deserves some blame and should take accountability for what he said.  At least he has 42% more subs now"" \[**[Hans also links THIS CLIP TO THE TWEET\]](https://clips.twitch.tv/GleamingFurryWalletCeilingCat-UkXTUyBQo4zqljj0) Tweet: [https://twitter.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1567665353727135746](https://twitter.com/HansMokeNiemann/status/1567665353727135746)
44. Former World Champion GM Anatoly Karpov chimes in on the situation with his take: ""I watched the game last night \[vs Niemann\] and I have to say that **Carlsen just played extremely badly**. I heard comments that he couldn't get out of the opening and had no chance, but that's not true. I reject all versions of an unfair win. Of course we can't say with certainty that Niemann didn't cheat, but Carlsen surprisingly played the opening so badly with white that he automatically got into a worse position. **But then he showed a strange inability to cope with the difficult situation that arose on the board**"" Source on TASS: Карпов оценил предположение о нечестной победе Ниманна над Карлсеном, via u/wwqt at [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x8v7dx/karpov\_carlsen\_played\_extremely\_badly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x8v7dx/karpov_carlsen_played_extremely_badly/)
45. Former World Champion Garry Kasparov shares his thoughts on the saga via two posts on Twitter:  
***Tweet 1*** *\[Cont'd from #45\]:* ""I will not delve into the **ugly insinuations** of the matter now, but must remark on what we do know: World chess champion Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the world's premier tournament in St. Louis, an act with no precedent in the past 50 years, and **his explanation is required**."".

***Tweet 2*** *\[Cont'd from #46\]:* ""Carlsen's withdrawal was a blow to chess fans, his colleagues at the tournament, the organizers, and, as the rumors and negative publicity swirl in a vacuum, to the game. **The world title has its responsibilities, and a public statement is the least of them here""**.

46. **\[\*\*MAJOR UPDATE\*\*\] Hikaru** goes on stream and responds to various items brought up by Hans in his Rnd.5 postgame interview (he did not watch on stream due to copyright): [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x97ske/full\_hikarus\_response\_to\_hans\_interview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/x97ske/full_hikarus_response_to_hans_interview/) (links to post with his full statement).  
Here is a brief breakdown of this main points, with the gist of each:  
*On the Magnus game opening* *and Hans' explanation that he prepped it via transpositions from similar lines*:  [""It is definitely plausible""](https://clips.twitch.tv/KawaiiAbrasiveYogurtChocolateRain-JX2ZNI_-3mJsB1pE?tt_content=channel_name&tt_medium=embed)

*On Hans being banned from the Chess.com Global Championship* *for the game against Magnus*: **""I of course had no idea, I'm actually quite shocked myself to hear this**, it's very surprising; I think Chess.com has to answer in some way, make a statement."" and ""doesn't really make a whole lot of sense."" (2:26 into the video)  
*On Hans' rapid rise in rating the past few years*: **""he's probably had the most meteoric rise in the history of chess**""; ""**it's unprecedented in the history of Chess.**"" (3:50 into the video)  
*On Hans' admission of cheating* *in the past on Chess.com*: ""**it is very good that Hans admitted cheating and I am really hopeful that** **Chess.com** **or Magnus there's gonna be some sort of statement in the future**. (5:00 into the video)  
*On* *Hans' new accent*: ""**I do think it's part of a persona, when you're streaming you do try and put on a persona**"" and ""he's definitely a showman."" (5:40 into the video).
47. In an article published on the Wall Street Journal, leading cheat-detection expert Kenneth Regan has found no evidence of cheating, as the article details: ""Tournament organizers, meanwhile, instituted additional fair play protocols. But their security checks, including game screening of Niemann’s play by one of the world’s leading chess detectives, the University at Buffalo’s Kenneth Regan, **haven’t found anything untoward**."" - WSJ [https://www.wsj.com/articles/magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-chess-cheating-scandal-11662644458](https://www.wsj.com/articles/magnus-carlsen-hans-niemann-chess-cheating-scandal-11662644458)

60. FM Andrii Punin uploads a video analyzing ""suspicious"" games that Hans has played in the past year, in particular, with reference to his average centipawn loss (ACPL). One of the observations--among many--is that in tournaments where Hans was between 2450 and 2550 Elo, i.e. between 2018 and 2020, his ACPL is around 20 or 23 (depending on the Stockfish version), which is basically normal for IM, but in the tournaments where he got his second and third GM norms, his ACPL was respectively 3 and 7\~9, denoting a high level of play.

I am watching the current cheating drama just as much as anyone else, but I feel like it is important to remember despite anything that might come out over the next few weeks at the end of the day Hans Niemann is a 19 year old teen and should not be made out to be some heinous villain regardless of the outcome.

In the possibility cheating has been uncovered, I think we should be kind as a community.  Whatever punishment could be handed down will be nothing compared to how Han's Would feel about himself if he was labelled a cheater and ostracized by the chess community.  I think we should all remember **this is a game**.  Yes, cheating is not in the spirit of the game and a very bad thing to do, but it doesn't make him a bad person.  It would mean he made mistakes and is facing the consequences of them.

Remember, Han's life is dedicated to chess.  Chess is everything to him and if that is taken away along with a massive dogpile on him from the community, it could be extremely harmful to his mental health, and no one deserves that for cheating in a game.

Not trying to take some kind of moral high ground, my point is we should just try to be kind as a community, regardless of the outcome!",3pmaccf7,2022-09-26,616,0.64, ,/r/chess/comments/xoi03d/regarding_the_mental_health_of_hans_niemann/

r/Chess,Submissions,xy4poc,t5_2qhr7,YSK that Hans Niemann was on the Norway Gnomes the first time he cheated in 2020,"According to the [Chess.com report](https://www.chess.com/blog/CHESScom/hans-niemann-report), the very first time Hans Niemann likely cheated in 2020 happened in the PRO Chess League, [when he played for the Norway Gnomes](https://www.prochessleague.com/norway-gnomes.html), the same team AND the same tournament (albeit different years) which the now resigned Norwegian Chess President [Nilsen cheated](https://www.chess.com/news/view/norwegian-chess-federation-president-nilsen-cheating) in.

Further, YSK that the winners of the 2020 Pro Chess League, in which Hans was likely cheating, were the Armenian Eagles, [whose team was disqualified](https://www.chess.com/news/view/saint-louis-arch-bishops-2020-pro-chess-champions) for cheating by Tigran L. Petrosian after reaching first place. Also, note that tournament took place during the midst of the pandemic.

YSK that even Hans Niemann allegedly cheated in the PRO league in 2020, we didn't know about it until the recent Chess.com report.

Further, a major reason that Petrosian got caught and his team disqualified is that [Wesley So famously](https://mobile.twitter.com/gothamchess/status/1311807797584179206) voiced his cheating suspicions.

Why is this all relevant? One reason--Chess.com had evidence of cheating from multiple GMs in a prize money tournament, and kept this information behind closed doors for years, seemingly only disclosing information when publicly pressured. This begs the question of the extent of cheating which has still been kept secret by Chess.com, although they have publicly revealed that they have ""hundreds"" of titled player cheating confessions.

What the cheating culture was during the pandemic is important to note, to contextualize some of Hans' actions. Exactly how commonplace and normalized was this?",6f4gg,2022-10-07,940,0.93, ,/r/chess/comments/xy4poc/ysk_that_hans_niemann_was_on_the_norway_gnomes/
r/Chess,Submissions,xvt3ml,t5_2qhr7,"1 day after the last game Hans cheated in (August 11, 2020), he was given a new Chess.com account where he's played more than 4000 games and improved his rating","August 11, 2020 is the last day where Chess.com allege Hans' cheated. Before this time, he used two accounts: [IMHansNiemann](https://www.chess.com/member/imhansniemann) and [HansCoolNiemann](https://www.chess.com/member/hanscoolniemann).

Since Chess.com indicate that Niemann admitted to cheating in 2020 and discussed his possible return to the site, it is logical that this happened on August 11th or August 12th, when he was then given a new account: [HansOnTwitch](https://www.chess.com/member/hansontwitch). He immediately starting using it on August 12th up until the end of August this year and played over 4000 games.

The rating charts indicate that Hans was able to maintain, and even improve, his rating on this new account. In fact, his highest blitz Elo out of all three accounts occurred on the newest one. Though his average accuracy does fall a couple percentage points which could be due to the lack of cheating.

Presumably Chess.com doesn't have enough evidence of cheating after August 2020 or they would have included it, as it would be the strongest contradiction in Hans statements and actually justify them banning him again. This backs up Hans claims that he cheated in ""random games"" to gain elo faster to where he ""should"" be, as he actually was able to maintain and improve that elo in games he did not cheat in (this does not mean that it's OK!).

Don't interpret this post as a defense of Hans, I am only looking at the facts and his statements.

Q: The whole world is wondering, Magnus, what was the reason you withdrew from that game?

A : Haha. Yeah unfortunately I cannot particularly speak on that.

But you know, people can draw their own conclusion and they certainly have.

I have to say I am very impressed by Neiman's play and I think his mentor  ~~maxiem~~ Maxim Dlugy must be doing a great job. \[Some context about Maxim : [https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/655nng/cheating\_incident/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/655nng/cheating_incident/) \]

Q : Can you confirm or not confirm it has to do with suspecting him of cheating?

A: I will not comment on that

Q: Magnus you mentioned a name there, I think maybe a trainer of Hans Niemann, that he is doing a good job, can you say more about that, is it because you think he is helping Hans, in the games?

A: No, (laughs), I will not say more about that subject.

Q:  Will you at some point make some comment on all the fuzz that is going on?

A: Yeah I hope to say a little bit more after the tournament.

Q: Is cheating in general a problem in chess, do you think?

A: I think individual people will answer differently depending on their own experiences.

Regardless of whether it is a massive problem or not, I think it is fairly easy to cheat, on a general basis, I think that cheaters in the future have to be..you know.. should not be taken lightly. Either online or over the board.

Q: Are organisers, FIDE doing enough to avoid cheating, and to punish if there is a suspicion of cheating?

A: Its hard to say really.

r/Chess,Submissions,xqibur,t5_2qhr7,Interview with GM Cornette (the guy who lost to Hans),"*You lost to Niemann in 2020. Did you have the feeling then that your opponent was playing beyond his means?*

I didn't know Hans before the match. I was told that he was a promising young man who streams his blitz games. I didn't know at the time that he had already been banned by Chess.com. During the game I saw nothing suspicious. But it's not in my nature to be paranoid.

*How did [the game](https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2021760) play out?*

*I had a good position and then made a very bad move. After that he literally rolled over me. I was impressed because I hadn't expected all his moves. But it was nothing impossible.*

*Some observers see it differently, as if Niemann had played on the edge of perfection.*

Many people have checked this game, and depending on which computer and which module were used, the result changes. Either way, it was a very good game. But I didn't think that this encounter would be discussed in such detail later.

*Is it unusual that young players can play at such a level?*

I played against Carlsen when he was 17. I have competed with almost all the great hopefuls. I know that you can be very strong at a young age. I played against Niemann in a December, he came in a T-shirt and sandals. When I talked to him for a minute after the match, I quickly realised that he is extremely conceited. In France we say ""un petit con"".

*Can you understand Carlsen's approach to the case?*

Cornette: I understand his approach, but I didn't like the form. His press release was quite devoid of content. I think and hope we will learn more soon. The way Magnus abandoned the tournament was clumsy. He obviously believes that his opponent cheated and that he must now act in the spirit of chess. But one is innocent until proven otherwise. Cheating is terrible, but falsely accusing someone is also very bad.

*Did you analyse the game in question between Carlsen and Niemann?*

Cornette: Yes, and I didn't have the impression that there was cheating during that game. There is no doubt that Hans is a talented and very strong player. His blitz game against World Blitz Champion Maxime Vachier-Lagrave recently in Paris proved that.

*Is cheating in chess a problem that deserves today's attention?*

Cornette: The problem is very serious, until now it has always been somewhat suppressed. When many tournaments were held online during the lockdowns, it was also not talked about enough. The problems with cheating really start when a strong, intelligent player does it. One who doesn't cheat on every move, not in every game.

*What does the whole discussion mean for chess?*

The whole thing is a sad affair. One can only hope that it will move things forward. Solutions are possible for major tournaments. Games that are broadcast online with a time delay. Occasional checks on the players. No electronic devices. All that exists, but not always. That's where you have to start.

In this case they would also be able to analyze the game normally after since they did 99% of the thinking. 

Just a few lines or moves from an engine would not show up as a different “engine correlation percentage”.

As a neutral observer, I can't stand by anymore","As an outside observer and chess player who has been following this sub for a while, I've never posted on this drama stuff before now. But at some point I feel like I gotta step in, because part of this community is getting absolutely ridiculous, and a teenager (who I am not a fan of and didn't even know existed before 2 weeks ago) is getting absolutely **stomped** by huge powers that have hundreds of millions of dollars and FAR more media presence and power. As a human being, I'm absolutely appalled at what's happening, and I can't stand by anymore.

Right now, Hans Niemann is a 19 year old who has become the face of cheating worldwide. He's on the New York Times, other major publications and late night talk shows are talking about what he's got shoved up his ass. **This is absolutely devastating.** He will be known by everyone he knows or meets as the ""cheater"". I really hope he's as introverted as he seems because that's his only saving grace right now.

Having your entire life and name exposed and vilified **internationally** is absolutely NOT a proportionate consequence to opening Stockfish for some online chess games. For any of you that disagree, you'd be shitting your pants if you did something bad or illegal (like everyone has) and your face is broadcast worldwide with your offense because of it. I'd wager many of you would get major depression/anxiety and it's virtually guaranteed that a non-zero amount of you internet tough guys would commit suicide over this happening to you. I know this is a giggle-fest where you F5 repeatedly to find the latest spiciest takes but have some compassion for the human.

I used to constantly skip chess videos to Magnus games because I loved watching him play and dominate opponents. I was a huge Magnus Carlsen fan, like many of you on both sides of this debacle. But it's obvious that he is a disgusting human being based on his actions right here, right now. He is destroying a kid's entire career and upending his life because of his arrogance (this sentence reads properly no matter who you attribute the last 'his' to) Carlsen believes he is 1000% right and cannot be making a mistake about Hans cheating during their OTB game, even though everyone can make mistakes, even the best human competitors. I know plenty of assholes who have done shitty things, and I hated them a lot, but as a decent human being, I would never want to make them an international embarrassment and completely fuck over their life. **That's how I know that Magnus is not a decent person.** Even if you really hate someone in private real bad, you don't go fuck up their life in front of hundreds of millions of people if you had a chance. Shit.

Oh by the way, why was Magnus happy to beat Hans during the Crypto Cup right before? And do a photo-op on the beach with him? I thought Magnus was taking a principled stand against all cheating?

It is absolutely fucking ridiculous that Chesscom has singled out Hans Niemann to this degree, even going as far as releasing confidential info about his coach in an attempt to make Hans look more guilty by association. Holy shit. They've been spending WEEKS preparing a shit dossier about Hans Niemann in particular, far more than they've ever done for any other admitted cheater. If the FBI decided to spend a few weeks fully coming up with a dossier full of the shit you've done, while not doing it for anyone else, you're not gonna be very happy about it I bet. **The CEO is up here teasing people about how Hans will really be fucked soon, and to get your popcorn ready.** People are really thinking that Chesscom is a neutral respectable third-party in this mess?

It's made worse by the fact that both Magnus and Chesscom have tens of millions of dollars, and they KNOW that no matter what happens here, they're both completely fine. They'll make even more money. It's a zero-risk game for them. It's a goddamn game for them. Hans Niemann has made jack in comparison to those guys, and he is the **only** person standing to suffer real consequences to his life from this.

Goddamn am I sad that when two multimillionaire industry powers decide to beat the everloving shit out of a poor 19 year old on the world stage, many Redditors pile on hard. I don't give a fuck if he's cheated in every single game he's played online, what's being done to him on the world stage has been FAR WORSE than online chess cheating. Oh yeah, and every other cheater in the game? I haven't heard jack shit about any other grandmasters who have cheated online, including ones that Magnus was happy playing against. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking this is about taking a principled stand against cheaters. This is about destroying Hans Niemann.

**TO MAGNUS:** You've already won dude. Hans is already fucked. His life is fucked. Everybody he knows is talking about him behind his back now. Every person he meets from now on will say ""Hey, aren't you that cheater in the news?"" He dared to take 7 ELO points off you with black and had a snarky interview and you fucking ended him. And you didn't even need to have a shred of evidence! Damn that power must be a rush.

r/Chess,Submissions,y9fcyk,t5_2qhr7,DID HANS ACTUALLY CONFESS IN 2020?(Chess.com report),"I just read the lawsuit and saw that Hans denied confessing to cheating in 2020 during a call between him and Danny Rensch. So I looked around in the [chess.com](https://chess.com) report and found a screenshot with a zoom call between hans and danny. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0qufb3dsy1v91.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59c37b2a0da8a766506805eb522ef1149adc1245

There is definitely a zoom call during this period between hans and danny, but whether hans actually admitted to cheating in these calls is a different story. But in the following messages, you can see indications that hans admitted to cheating on the call.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tpv8sa4bz1v91.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=33e61acb1f70d0a90b18e9fe2ce5faf6edecdde7

You can see hans here asking if he needs to send a written statement. To which Danny replies that he needs to send a mail acknowledging his offense. Hans replies with an ok. If he didn't confess to cheating on the call, why is he ok with sending a mail to account review( he actually didn't send the mail, but he clearly instigates this conversation about statements and is ok with it when danny asks him to email a statement).  We also know that [chess.com](https://chess.com) allows cheaters to come back if they confess to cheating. So, If he did not confess to cheating why was he allowed to have another account. 

He was also banned from prize money tournaments for 6 months after he got his new account. During this time hans wanted danny to make an exception so that he could participate in us chess qualifiers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pdbg6up512v91.png?width=1154&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fcedd182d1341b35fb87b26274e6df8476514f7

In the above image you can see him ask danny to make an exception. In the next sentence he also states that he understands if danny doesn't let him play because of his past mistakes. Again I believe that his statements about past mistakes seem to strongly indicate that he confessed during the zoom call. 

In the next message danny says that they can't risk such a high profile event. Danny in this message confirms that his ban is due to cheating. So his ban may not have been due to other reasons.

Hans then replies to danny that it was a completely fair decision on danny's part. If Hans didn't confess, why is he being so accommodating to danny.  

One can claim that Hans was forced to confess in the zoom call. But if he got blackmailed, why didn't he mention that in his lawsuit. The lawsuit doesn't say he got blackmailed to confess, the lawsuit  just says he didn't confess at all during a call with danny. 

While he may not have issued a direct statement, His call with danny and the following conversations seem to indicate that he confessed during the call.",90ur9xk8,2022-10-21,83,0.77, ,/r/chess/comments/y9fcyk/did_hans_actually_confess_in_2020chesscom_report/

r/Chess,Submissions,xvun12,t5_2qhr7,Comparing Hans Niemann's Round 5 interview with WSJ / Chess.com's allegations,"With the recent WSJ article we now know some of the allegations of Chess.com against Hans Niemann.  I thought it would be interesting to compare what we know of Chess.com's allegations against Niemann's personal interview statements.

Using Chess24's interview transcript as a source for the interview quotes (https://new.chess24.com/wall/news/hans-niemann-answers-his-critics)

Niemann in his interview admits to cheating twice, once when he was 12, and once when he was 16.

Niemann on cheating at 12:
>When I was 12 years old, I was with a friend and I was playing Titled Tuesday. I was playing, and he came over with an iPad with an engine, and I was 12 years old, and he said, sort of giving me the moves. I was a child, I had no idea what happened. This happened once, in an online tournament. I was just a child, and nothing happened then.

Niemann on cheating at 16, says he cheated in an unrated game:
>Now four years later, when I was 16 years old during my streaming career, in an absolutely ridiculous mistake, in an unrated game… other than that, after I was 12, I had never, ever in my life cheated in an over-the-board game, in an online tournament. They were unrated games, and I’m admitting this, and I’m saying my truth, because I do not want any misrepresentation.

There maybe is a bit of confusion in this statement.  Niemann goes on to say he cheated to get higher rated, which (to me) implies that he did in fact cheat in multiple ""random"" rated games? Possibly he meant that he didn't cheat in tournament games.

Niemann on cheating at 16, continued:

>""I wanted to gain some rating, I just wanted to get higher-rated so I could play stronger players, so I cheated in random games on Chesscom. Now, I was confronted, I confessed, and this is the single biggest mistake of my life and I’m completely ashamed, and I’m telling the world because I do not want any misrepresentation and I do not want rumours.

Niemann says he was 16 years old at the time, draws a line between ""random"" and ""real"" games and says he would never cheat in a ""real"" game.  Niemann does not strictly define what he believes the difference to be between ""random"" vs ""real"" games.

>Now this happened, I’m deeply, deeply ashamed of it, but keep in mind I was 16 years old, I never wanted to hurt anyone, these were random games. I would never even fathom doing it in a real game.

Niemann also says in his interview that he has never, and would never cheat in a tournament for money.

Niemann on cheating in tournament and on stream:
>Other than when I was 12 years old, I have never, ever, ever, and I would never do that, that is the worst thing I could ever do, cheat in a tournament with prize money. Now I made that mistake, and it’s not something I was doing consistently, never when I was streaming did I cheat, never did I misrepresent my strength.

So my reading on Niemann's overall summary of his cheating is: Niemann claims to have cheated twice, one at 12 during a titled tuesday, and once at 16, only in unrated or ""random"" games.  He says he never cheated when he was on stream, and that besides the titled Tuesday incident when he was 12, he never cheated in a tournament with prize money.



----



Now that we've seen Niemann's statements on his Chess.com cheating history, let's compare with the recent Chess.com article and see the claims Chess.com makes against him in the Wall Street Journal article (found at https://www.wsj.com/articles/chess-cheating-hans-niemann-report-magnus-carlsen-11664911524)

WSJ:
>The report, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, alleges that Niemann likely received illegal assistance in more than 100 online games, as recently as 2020. Those matches included contests in which prize money was on the line. 

From a photo in the WSJ article credited to Chess.com (looks like a screenshot of the 72 page document):
>Overall, we have found that Hans has likely cheated in more than 100 online chess games, including several prize money events.  He was already 17 when he likely cheated in some of these matches and games.  He was also streaming in 25 of these games.


From these statements, Chess.com seems to be directly refuting multiple of Niemann's interview statements.  Chess.com says:

* Niemann's cheating was extensive (over 100 games in total)
* Many of these cheating games were on-stream games 
* Some of these games were also in online tournaments, with prize money on the line.  
* Niemann was 17 years old during some of this cheating (somewhat of a technicality, but still relevant to Niemann's claims that it was only when he was younger)

EDIT: updating with some of the official Chess.com report as seen at (https://www.chess.com/blog/CHESScom/hans-niemann-report)

Chess.com says directly that they disagree with certain statements made by hans:
>•""Other than when I was 12 years old, I have never, ever, ever – and I would never do that, that is
the worst thing that I could ever do – cheat in a tournament with prize money.”

>• “Never when I was streaming did I cheat.”

>• “Keep in mind I was 16 years old, I never wanted to hurt anyone, these were random games. I
would never – could even fathom doing it – in a real game.”

>As discussed in more detail below, we disagree with these statements.

Also in Danny's email to Hans (Exhibit B of the Chess.com report), he lays out specific tournament events that Chess.com identifies as having been cheated in by Hans:
>While there are other potential events,
games and evidence that reinforce the untruth of your public claims, specifically for the purposes of this
letter, we are informing you that some of our strongest data suggests you violated Fair Play on the
following dates:

>● Titled Tuesday Qualifier | July 7 2015

>o Of particular note in this event is that you played against and lost to someone we
eventually closed for cheating in that very same event, and that your game reflected
clear “engine vs engine” play.

>● Titled Tuesday Qualifier | April 4 2017

>● PRO Chess League | 2020 Season

>o Numerous games and performances

>● Speed Chess Grand Prix | June 2 2020

>● Speed Chess Grand Prix | June 16 2020

>In addition to the direct monetary benefit that a top standing / prize position in those events would earn
you, the rating points gained were significantly beneficial to you, as you admitted to me in our call 


If Chess.com's allegations are true, they would point to multiple direct and indirect falsehoods in Niemanns public statements about his cheating on Chess.com.  Indeed, the WSJ article implies that Niemann's interview statements on his Chess.com ban were what prompted Chess.com to reinstate their ban, as well as publicly share the basis for their findings against Niemann.  I cannot comment as to how strong the Chess.com evidence is, but if you do trust their analysis, it seems to invalidate many of Niemann's own statements, and calls into question his overall level of honesty. 



----




Finally, there is Niemann's statement on OTB cheating:
>I have never cheated in an over-the-board game.

Chess.com does not directly comment on OTB cheating, but the report suggests that there is a possibility of it having occurred.    
WSJ:
>Chess.com noted that it hasn’t historically been involved with cheat detection for classical over-the-board chess, and it stopped short of any conclusive statements about whether he has cheated in person. Still, it pointed to several of Niemann’s strongest events, which it believes “merit further investigation based on the data.”

If Hans truly cheated in the PRO league, that would be insane, and shouldn't Chess.com have immediately acted and banned him? Why wait for so long? Why wait for a GM to cheat in 100+ games as they allege, including multiple prize money tournaments?

Did they not catch this earlier? That's weird. So that means this cheating was newly found after Magnus withdrew from St Louis? Why didn't the famous cheat detection algorithms catch this earlier? Or, does Hans have a point, and is some of this evidence contrived after the fact? Things don't seem to add up to me in a way that's favorable to Chess.com.

Further, if Chess.com are totally cool allowing GMs to cheat in 100+ games and multiple prize money tournaments before asking for a ""secret"" confession and allowing those players to continue playing on the site after (until major drama), how many other GMs have cheated repeatedly without public knowledge or even action from Chess.com? Isn't it weird that Hans Niemann is singled out, 2 years after his last alleged cheating incident, when there surely are other GMs who have cheated more recently on the site?

Also, the question of Hans cheating was originally strictly limited to OTB chess,  related to Hans' FIDE rating from OTB and specifically his OTB match against Carlsen. It seems as if Chess.com re-banned Hans from their competitions right after Magnus withdrew from Sinquefield, and then never really did explain the recency of their decision to remove Hans from the CGC. Instead, they first leaked their report to the WSJ (for the public interest, as they maintain) about Hans allegedly cheating more than admitted, more than 2 years ago, highlighting the number of games. In retrospect it seemed to be a move which shifted the spotlight away from their puzzling reaction to Magnus withdrawing, which is relevant to the chess community given the merger between the Magnus group and Chess.com.

Chess.com says that Hans Niemann's lawsuit ""hurts the game of Chess"", but perhaps there are real important questions about how a private monopoly in chess can run into issues with favoritism and suppression of outing cheating by all players fairly when it damages their bottom line.

“Hello!

Shaun here, Director of Support.

Thank you so much for writing in. So many people hear all the rumors on line and then don't even check in with us to see what our company is actually saying. And I get it, we've got famous streamers on both sides of this issue making both camps mad. So I'm fielding quite a bit of criticism that ranges from ""why is Hans' account still open?"" To ""how dare you close his account.""

I hope you will see, however, that our coverage has been quite fair. I'll link it here:
https://www.chess.com/today

As you can see, we've made no public accusations at this juncture.

Obviously, we cannot confirm or deny actions like that taken toward any account. BUT, what I can say is that Hans is an excellent competitor and chess player, and that he has long since earned my respect as a chess fan. When I had a chance to speak to him in Dubai, he seemed like a good guy. He wasn't the worst football player or journalist either!

If we had any point to make, my man Hans is in a tournament right now. He's got bigger fish on his plate to fry, like Fabi, than us right now.

When he's done, if there's anything he needs to talk to us about, or any accusations to clear, he'll have all the time in the world to do so. Despite mentioned that he felt betrayed by us in an interview, in that SAME interview he also mentioned how good our detection is, and how good his relationship has been with us through thick and thin in the past. No matter what goes down in this tournament and any ensuing fallout, I don't think that will change.

He just needs to keep his head down and kick butt over the board right now. Any additional stuff he may or may not need to clear up with us would be for later!

So with all that preamble in mind. all I ask is that you withhold judgement for a bit to see how the cards land, what information comes out, and to get a better idea of what Chess.com is actually is doing and why or why not we're either taking action or refraining from doing so--before you make a judgement!”",47ppn,2022-09-07,164,0.73, ,/r/chess/comments/x7z127/i_sent_chesscom_a_support_message_explaining_that/

Petrosian,"If it simply boils down to Hans cheating in prized online tournaments and not OTB, then I think his punishments shouldn't be that much different compare to Tigran L. Petrosian's case. Do note that Petrosian was also accused of cheating in PRO Chess League, the same tournament in which [chess.com](https://chess.com) is accusing Hans of cheating. Petrosian in the end got lifetime banned from the website as well as PRO Chess League, nothing really happened to his OTB status except you do see him relatively less often in OTB nowadays (may also have to do with the fact that his rating is not that high to begin with)

I think Hans may end up in a similar fashion, where he will kinda get ""shadowbanned"" OTB because more players may start refusing to play with him. He may still appear way more often than Petrosian because he's definitely a much better player. In the end, online cheating wouldn't lead to any ""official"" punishments for someone's OTB career from chess governing bodies, but their colleagues, the top GMs, absolutely have the right to refuse to play with them and not see in them in a respectful light.",b6w9bqol,2022-10-05,27,0.62, ,/r/chess/comments/xw69kh/hans_niemann_should_be_treated_similarly_to/
r/Chess,Submissions,xvt7q4,t5_2qhr7,"Hans' previous cheating online, and their relevance to the current situation","With the WSJ reporting on the chess.com report, it seems clear that Hans was not as truthful as one would hope when referencing past cheating. This is the table showing the tournaments that he is alleged to have cheated in: [[Table]](https://i.imgur.com/MtgHeOn.png). 

A few things pop out here:

 - All but one event was Blitz. Only 12/32 games in the rapid event were flagged as likely cheating. 
 - He appears to have had 3 sets of cheating. 
 - The first at 12 years of age. 
 - The second at 13 years of age. 
 - The third, and biggest one, from February 2020 to August 2020, this being 16-17 years of age, during the height of the Covid lockdowns. 

Claims will likely be thrown around that this is 'only when he's been caught', but looking at the games, in all but one tournament, 100% of the games were flagged. It seems unlikely, given they've gone through his career with a fine toothed comb, that it's missing much. 

Now, out of this, it's interesting on its own that the cheating stopped in late 2020. This is likely due to the ban he received. This opens up some interesting questions, however:

 - Does cheating in Blitz online really relate to over the board play?
 - Does age and context come into account? This is a literal child, during the Covid lockdowns, cheating online in Blitz, though in proper events. 
 - Does the previous instances of cheating while not even, to barely even, a teenager, come into account when considering the above? 
 - Does the fact it all stopped well before the current events have relevance? 
 - Does the end of cheating in the above even imply that he stopped, or more, that he became more sophisticated? 

Honestly, I don't have proper answers to any of the above, though I'm sure plenty here reading do. This entire saga has given me a great sense of unease largely due to the lack of evidence we actually have relevant to the actual event. It feels like too much trial by public opinion, and much of the attempts to 'end' the drama have come from things like this report, trying to tar and feather Hans based on his past, rather than the events itself. 

In fact, the most interesting point raised in all of this is the 6 suspicious games as noted, but not revealed, which were over the board. I hope that these are revealed soon, and FIDE's position on these is made clear quickly. 

Again, I really don't know what to make of all of this, but part of me doesn't like the idea of the mistakes of a child during the Covid lockdowns ending their career. This all said, they were a titled player at the time, in proper events. 

I do hope proper change comes through all this, however. There needs to be more cooperation between FIDE and sites like chess.com, and I think greater transparency would also help. I, personally, do not understand why the list of cheaters needs to be private. If the fear is cheaters not wanting to play on chess.com, then surely that is only a good thing, but that's another point all together.",fapck,2022-10-04,14,0.6, ,/r/chess/comments/xvt7q4/hans_previous_cheating_online_and_their_relevance/

He was not even a grandmaster."" And then he started to play live and well, as Peter said in one of the previous episodes, he had no openings at all. I mean, the guy was just playing Blitz all day. And, you can fix openings, that was your point. It seems that he fixed them, and now every time he's playing he's winning rating; 2760 or something. So he became a very strong player in something like one year or a couple of years. That's very weird to me.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",6d5hpwad,2022-09-24,557,0.98, ,/r/AnarchyChess/comments/xmqr81/i_work_at_a_grocery_store_across_the_street_from/

“It’s not what it looks like!” Hans stammered, wrapping himself up in covers. 

“We were just about to reveal our love to the world!” Magnus shouted in fury, “What am I gonna tell all our friends? What am I gonna tell Hikaru?!?!”

Hans looked at the floor while the guilt finally hit him.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the bed and revealed himself. Ben Finegold. 

Covering his modesty, he spoke in a quiet shameful whisper, “I’m sorry Magnus. It was my birthday after all. The truth hurts.” 

Ben retrieved his brick from the bed, and walked towards the door while Magnus stared in shock and heartbreak. 

Magnus’s gaze returned to Hans. “It’s over.”

Hans’s eyes filled with tears. 

“Magnus wait- what about the tournament?! What about our love?!”

“I’m withdrawing from the tournament. I never want to see you again.” Magnus stated, coldly.

I also think it's a little inappropriate to write 72 pages on a private relationship between Magnus and Hans, especially when the use of anal beads is so heavily implicated.

Apparently the report also implicates hundreds of other GMs. We all know Magnus fucks, but it's a little hard to believe that he has affairs with hundreds of GMs.

r/Chess,Submissions,xmtr0q,t5_2yvry,I work at a sex shop across the street from the St. Louis Chess Club. I have interacted with Hans on multiple occasions,"He's an alright kid - looks much older than a 19-year-old. This will become important later.

First time he came in he didn't put on an accent and spent a long time hanging around the anal section. He asked me what the largest size dildo we stocked was. I told him we had triple XL but we could order in a quad XL if needed. He didn't need that much size and went with the triple XL. I'd say compared to most of the bourgeoisie a-holes that find themselves in there (pun intended) he is one of the easiest people to serve and very appreciative of the work we do.

Second time he came in he ordered a bunch of beads and other accessories, I remember specifically he wanted Lovesense beads that could be operated from a distance. Not that unusual a request. Anyway, I sold him all that and when you spend over $100 bucks we throw in a bottle of free liquor. Me thinking the dude was much older than 19 I didn't even think about it. 

Anyway fast forward a week and my manager's reading all these news articles about 'the biggest cheating scandal in chess' etc and realises he's seen the dude before on our CCTV. Motherfucker realises we've served Hans all this sex shit and booze and he's well under 21. Well my ass was grass and my manager had the lawnmower. In other words, I got fired the same day and apparently the shop is being sued by Chess.com.

The dimwits over at r/chess are currently misusing stats and calling for Hans’ head. Even Hikaru has said if Hans doesn’t give Magnus permission to speak it means he’s guilty. 

I would like to remind everyone that if you torture someone enough - be it physical or psychological - they will eventually crumble and admit to anything. They’ve already coerced him into saying he’s cheated in the past, which we all know to be false. 

The torture isn’t only psychological, it’s been rumoured to have gotten physical too. DNA analysis has been done on several FIDE official bricks and found Hans’ DNA on them, even though we all know he’d never decline en passant. A 19 year old can only withstand so much until he caves and makes stuff up to make it go away. We must take a stand against this abuse over at r/chess if we want to protect the integrity of our game!",icrpgeqf,2022-09-29,159,0.98, ,/r/AnarchyChess/comments/xqwpi3/dear_redditors_if_you_torture_hans_long_enough_he/
r/Chess,Submissions,zhxydl,t5_2yvry,An Epic Story: Magnus vs Hans,"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a young boy named Magnus Carlsen. Despite his young age, Magnus was incredibly cunning and intelligent, and he possessed a strange power - the ability to control bananas
Magnus's banana powers were unique and incredibly quirky. He could use his powers to make bananas sing and dance, which he would use to distract and confuse his enemies. He could also use his powers to make bananas incredibly soft and squishy, which he would use to cushion his falls and protect himself from harm. But his most bizarre power was the ability to make bananas extremely spicy, which he would use to burn and irritate his enemies' eyes and noses.

At first, Magnus used his powers for good, helping the people of his village by using his banana powers to protect them from harm. But as he grew older, Magnus's powers grew stronger and he began to crave more and more power.
Eventually, Magnus's thirst for power consumed him, and he turned to the dark side, using his banana powers for evil. He would use his powers to manipulate the people of his village, forcing them to do his bidding and carry out his evil plans.
One day, Magnus's reign of terror came to the attention of a great hero, who immediately set out to stop him.

As the hero and Magnus prepared to face off in a final battle, the people of the village held their breath, waiting to see who would emerge victorious. But the outcome of the battle was not yet known...

Hans Niemann was just a normal kid, living a simple life in a small village. He didn't have any extraordinary powers or abilities, and he was content with the way things were.

But one day, everything changed. Hans discovered that he had a unique power - the ability to stretch out his anus incredibly wide. At first, he was unsure of how to use this power, and he kept it a secret from everyone, including his family and friends.

But as Hans grew older, he realized that his power could be used for good. He began to use his power to help the people of his village, using his wide anus to suck up debris and trash that littered the streets, and even to rescue people who were trapped in tight spaces.

With his newfound power, Hans became a hero to the people of his village, and they praised him for his bravery and selflessness.

As the battle between Hans and Magnus raged on, Hans knew that he would need to use his unique power to its full potential in order to defeat Magnus and his quirky banana powers.

Hans focused his energy and began to stretch out his anus to its maximum capacity. As he did so, he felt a powerful suction force building up within him, and he used this force to suck up Magnus's singing and dancing bananas.

Magnus, taken aback by Hans's strange power, was unable to stop him, and his bananas were quickly sucked up into Hans's wide anus.

But Magnus was not deterred. He quickly conjured up a new batch of bananas, this time making them incredibly spicy. He threw them at Hans, hoping to burn and irritate his eyes and nose.

Hans, caught off guard by the spicy bananas, felt a burning sensation in his anus as the spicy bananas entered his body. He gritted his teeth and fought through the pain, determined to defeat Magnus and protect his village.

Despite the searing pain in his anus, Hans continued to use his suction power to suck up the spicy bananas. He used his powerful anus muscles to squeeze the bananas, but the spicy juice only seemed to make the pain worse.

Hans could feel the skin around his anus begin to burn and blister, and he could barely hold on to the bananas as they slipped through his fingers. But still, he refused to give up.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Hans was able to squeeze the last of the spicy bananas into a pulp. The pain in his anus was almost unbearable, but he knew that he had to continue the fight.

Hans used his suction power to pull Magnus towards him, and then he used his powerful anus muscles to trap Magnus inside.
Inside Hans's wide anus, Magnus struggled and writhed in pain as the spicy banana pulp coated his body. The juice burned his skin, and the pulp clogged his nostrils and mouth, making it difficult for him to breathe.
Hans, filled with anger and determination, squeezed his anus muscles even tighter, crushing Magnus and causing him even more pain.
But instead of showing mercy, Hans continued to squeeze, determined to make Magnus suffer for his actions.
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Magnus's struggles grew weaker and weaker, until he was finally still.
Hans, victorious, released his grip on Magnus and let his lifeless body fall to the ground.
The people of the village, horrified by the gruesome scene, cheered and celebrated Hans's victory. They hailed him as a hero and praised him for his bravery and determination.
And Hans, the hero with the stretchy anus, was celebrated as a hero and celebrated for his bravery and determination, despite the intense pain and discomfort he had suffered. He had saved his village from Magnus and his quirky banana powers, and he would be remembered as a hero for generations to come.

r/Chess,Submissions,x7crii,t5_2yvry,Did Hans Niemann cheat? An ANALysis,"Now we all know that based on the Sinquefield Cup's strict anti cheating measures, we can logically deduce that the only way he could have possibly cheated was using anal beads.

Moves could easily be signalled by clenching his butt in morse code.

However, there is some problems with this hypothesis.

**Issue 1: The metal detector**

[In this clip] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIulWkTHuu0) we see Niemann entire body scanned by a metal detector. Would this not pick up the anal beads?

It likely would. However, it make me possible that Niemann got butt implants to give him cake, and also the silicon would stop any metal detection signals from picking up the butt device.

**Issue 2: Battery life**

I've done some extensive research on remote controlled butt plugs, and most seem to have a maximum of 1 hours of battery life.

These, however, are for pleasure and would require more energy to send a message. Or maybe Niemann is just into that.

It would seem that Niemann would need some non-commercially made, bespoke anal beads, that use less power by vibrating less.

**Issue 3: Cooling**

The first question is, is the anal bead receiving messages for the next move from the outside, or does it have stockfish installed on it directly?

As we covered earlier, to cheat Niemann must have got silicone butt implants, which would stop the beads from receiving any messages from the outside. So Niemann worked alone.

Now, with stockfish installed and running on a computer inside the beads, wouldn't they get far too hot? The only explanation is that prior to the game Niemann consumed several cans of beans so he could fart for cooling.

So now the question is: did anyone see Niemann eating beans?

**Conclusion:**

Niemann may have cheated, but it's only possible if he got butt implants, commissioned bespoke anal beads, and ate an excessive amount of beans before the match. FIDE should follow through accordingly and find out what Niemann had for breakfast.",5rukt,2022-09-06,74,1.0, ,/r/AnarchyChess/comments/x7crii/did_hans_niemann_cheat_an_analysis/

r/Chess,Submissions,x91gli,t5_2yvry,[Non-Anarchy-Submission] So I think I know how they can prove whether or not Hans cheated.,"Edit: imagine not understanding intuitively that this is satire.

This is a non-anarchy submission. It's a serious post, I know it's not the right subreddit but people over at /r/chess aren't really so open to serious discussion sometimes if it goes against their narrative. If this submission isn't welcome here then I apologize.

I think that if they wanted to ascertain whether or not Hans cheated, they need to redo the game but under different circumstances.

The players need to play again in a closed room with only one trusted arbiter, and both players need to be thoroughly searched. 

Most importantly, though, **they need to play the same game again**. They need to agree that from the start they are playing the same game, the same opening sequence. This way, the world can know for sure whether Hans can win against Magnus during that opening with definitely no cheating. If the game is the same with the exact same move order until the end, then we know that Hans did not cheat in the original game. However, if he loses or draws, well, I think that's proof enough that at the very least, something was not right in the original game.

Seems like a pretty fair way to determine, no? Thoughts?",8o2ml,2022-09-08,7,0.7, ,/r/AnarchyChess/comments/x91gli/nonanarchysubmission_so_i_think_i_know_how_they/
